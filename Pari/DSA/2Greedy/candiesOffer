-Sorting is essential for greedy selection of candies.

-Two-pointer approach is used for both minimum and maximum calculations.

-Greedy strategy: Always pay for the candies that will minimize or maximize your total cost, and take the rest for free as per the offer.

Time Complexity: Dominated by the sorting step, i.e., 
O(NlogN)


So the goal isn't just to maximize money spent, it’s:

⚠️ "To cover all candies, and spend as much (or as little) as possible under the buy-1-get-K-free constraint."
